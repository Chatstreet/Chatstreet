# ChatStreet-Backend
School project module - 347. Deployable chat application.

## Run Flask Server

Firstly install all of the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file.
I recommend you using a virtual environment for this.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the MiSe in development mode use the following command:

```shell
python chatstreet.constroller.py
```
